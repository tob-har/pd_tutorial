#X text 159 157 Pd Patches are visual representations of source code.
In windows like this one \, called a patcher \, you create patches
from scratch.;
#X text 227 202 Every patch is stored as a Pd File: .pd In most cases
it is very handy to create one folder per project and put in all the
.pd files \, that belong together.;
#X text 143 264 You can nest one Pd patch into another. These are called
subpatches if they are launched from within the original mail patch
\, or abstractions \, if they are stored somewhere else \, and just
referred to via the main patch.;
#X text 233 359 Pd objects are basically snippets if C code. You can
write your own new objects or exchange them. Objects \, that are not
part of the so called Pd Vanilla Distribution are called externals.
The idea behind that is: Everybody using Pd Vanilla has the same objects
\, and if you put an external into your code \, then you know about
it \, and can include it \, if you share your patch.;
#X text 96 515 1) Download Pd Vanilla \, latest Versin (Several Distributions
can live on the same machine \, so donwload more versions \, if necessary)
2) Let Pd create the standard externals folder. go for it.;
